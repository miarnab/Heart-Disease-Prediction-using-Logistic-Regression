# Heart Disease Prediction using Logistic Regression
Heart Disease Prediction using Logistic Regression is a Machine Learning project to detect Chronic Heart Disease using the Framingham dataset
Steps involved in this project:
1. Importing Libraries
2. Importing Dataset
3. Handling Missing Values
4. Spliting Dataset into Test and Train
5. Exploratory Data Analysis
6. Fitting Logistic Regression Model for Heart Disease Prediction
7. Evaluating the Logistic Regression Model
8. Developing the Confusion Matrix
